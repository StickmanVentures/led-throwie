# led-throwie
A 3d printable model for building LED throwies for people of all ages.

## What's required to build these?

1. Print one of the models in the repo (we've added different single, 6-count, 12-count models for simplicity).
2. Find yourself an LED (we've used 5mm and 10mm without issue)
3. Find yourself a CR2032 battery (available at most corner markets or online)
4. (Optional) A resistor for your LED

## What's it look like?

## Why this design?

So you can build, snap, and go!

## What were they used for?

We showed them off at Hickman Charter Schools' STEM Maker Faire. See our [blog post](blog/2016/05/12/sharing-technology-science-and-creativity-at-hickman-charters-stem-maker-faire/) for more information and additional press coverage.
